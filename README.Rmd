# Predicting the Severity of Pedestrian Collisions in the City of Toronto

## Description
The project investigates the drivers that explain the probability that a pedestrian collision will result in major injury or fatality in the City of Toronto. Understanding theses factors could help policy makers design the appropriate road safety campaigns, road safety infrastructure and similar activities that could contribute to the success of the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan. 

Random Forest algorithm was implemented through the "Ranger package" in R to solve this classification problem. The Random Forest model parameters mtry (...) and min_n were hyper-tuned using the grid search method in Ranger. The processed data had 1, rows with 12 variables, excluding the binary outcome variable. The data was imbalanced since the class pedestrian collision resulting in mojor injury or fatality accounted for 11% of the rows in the outcome variable (serious_fatality). We solved this imbalance problem with the SMOTE algorithm in the "DMwR" R package. This increased the representation of the minoriy class to 24%. 

Figure 1. below shows the factors that are key to explaining the likelihood of a pedestrian collision resulting in a serious injury or death.

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub.
