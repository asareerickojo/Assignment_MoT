# Predicting the Severity of Pedestrian Collisions in the City of Toronto

## Description
The project investigates the drivers that explain the probability that a pedestrian collision will result in major injury or fatality in the City of Toronto. Understanding theses factors could help policy makers design the appropriate road safety campaigns, road safety infrastructure and similar activities that could contribute to the success of the City of Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan. 

## Methods

Random Forest algorithm was implemented through the "Ranger package" in R to solve this classification problem. The Random Forest model parameters mtry (...) and min_n were hyper-tuned using the grid search method in Ranger. The processed data had 1677 rows and 12 variables (excluding the binary outcome variable). The data was imbalanced since the class pedestrian collision resulting in mojor injury or fatality accounted for 11% of the rows in the outcome variable (serious_fatality). The imbalanced problem was solved with the SMOTE algorithm in the "DMwR" R package. This increased the representation of the minoriy class to 24%. 

## Results

Figure 1. below shows the factors that are key to explaining the likelihood of a pedestrian collision resulting in a serious injury or death.

Wehort description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out?


## Installation
The project has been designed to ensure reproducibilty through the Renv package in R. You can replicate the results through the following two options:    

A. In the root folder of this repository, you can run the run.R script to automatically implement the data wrangling, SMOTE analysis, and model estimation. You can also modify the custom functions in functions.R script (R/functions.R) to change the results of the study.   
B1. if you are using Mac you can run the run.R script:    
    i). in the command line type cd working directory,    
    ii). run the command "Rscript run.R". If you do not have pandoc please install with "brew install pandoc"   
B2. if you have Windows install pandoc through the command "winget install pandoc" and run the run.R script.    

In the renv.lock file in the root folder, you will find important information on all the packages I used for this project.

## License

This project was conducted for the Ministry of Transportation as part of a job interviewing process. Access is retricted only to that institution and the affiliations they will authorize to modify the project.

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub.
